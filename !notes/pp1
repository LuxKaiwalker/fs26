ideas in paralell programming: 
we try to incorporate visual computing and find good foundations for this

challenges, althogh paralell tasks can be achieved using split up, the coordination can be bottleneck in performance

eine gleichmaessige aufteilung hierbei auch wichtig!

shared ressource (race condition)

lockout, ressource problems?
general memory access problems may exist!

what are working communication protocols for parallelism though then?

how to large scale software engineering? 


-> process (algo and data structures), communication, objects (structural aspects)

then, SPCA and CN. 

tip: just read intro

ex classes etc?
